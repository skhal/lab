**27** - find lower bound

Description
===========

Problem
-------

Given a sorted array nn, find lower bound for a number x. A lower bound is defined as the minimal value in nn that is not less than x.

Example
-------

The array is [1, 3, 4]. Lower bound for 2 is 3, and for 3 is 3.

Solution
--------

Use binary search to lookup for x but return the upper bound. Take care of the
cases when there is no upper bound available if the value x is above the maximum
number in the array.
