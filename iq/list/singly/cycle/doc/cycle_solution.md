# NAME

**cycle solution** - detect cycles in a singly linked list


# DESCRIPTION

Run two iterators through the list at different speeds, say one step and two
steps per iteration, and check whether the iterators point at the same item in
the list. If cycle is present, the two pointers will eventually match.

Make sure to shortcut the loop if one of the iterators is nil.


Complexity:

  * *Time*: O(n) - scan all items
  * *Space*: O(1) - two pointers
