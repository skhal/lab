NAME
====

**anagram solution** - find anagrams in a string

DESCRIPTION
===========

Use a fixed sliding window to scan through the string to check whether sub-strings are anagrams of the target string.

Complexity
----------

Assuming s has length n and t has length k, then:

-	*Time*: O(n) - scan through characters in the string.
-	*Space*: O(1) - constant space for character frequency storage.
