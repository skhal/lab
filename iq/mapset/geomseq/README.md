# NAME

**geomseq** - find triplets of geometric sequences in a collection


# DESCRIPTION

## Problem

Given a collection of numbers, find the number of triples of
[geometric sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression) in a
collection such that items at indices i, j, and k satisfy the following
condition: i < j < k.

## Example

*Input*: [3, 1, 2, 3, 9, 3, 27] and ratio is 3

*Output*: 3 because of triples [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], and [1, 3, 4]
