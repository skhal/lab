# NAME

**two sum solution** - solution to pair sum in unsorted array


# DESCRIPTION

## Brute force

There are two scans:

  1. Scan the array to build a map of values to indices.
  2. Scan the array a second time to find a complement number for a given item,
     i.e., for a given item `n1` find an item `target - n1`. If no such
     item exists, scan for the next item in the array.

## Optimal

Notice that if `n1` is given, then we need to efficiently find
`n2 = target - n1`, and vice versa - if `n2` is given, the problem reduces to
finding `n1 = target - n2`.

This observation has two corollaries:

  * Given `n1` we are looking ahead for `n2`
  * Given `n2` we are looking back for `n1`

The brute-force solution uses the first fact, therefore pre-build a map to keep
track of all items-to-index translation to lookup for `n2` for a given `n1`.

The optimal solution makes a single pass and looks for `n1` for a given `n2` in
a hash map.

## Complexity

*Time*: O(n)

*Space*: O(n) to store all items in a hash map in the worst case.

> [!NOTE]
> The optimal solution will short-cut more often on average than the brute-force
> solution.
