# NAME

**stripzero solution** - solution to in place zero out matrix problem


# DESCRIPTION

## Solution

Use two hash sets to keep track of rows and columns to zero out. Scan the matrix
to fill these sets in a first pass and then zero out marked rows and columns.

### Complexity

*Time*: O(m * n)

*Space*: O(m + n) to track rows and columns

## Optimization

Observe that if a row or a column to be zeroed out, it zeroes the very first row
or column respectively. Use this fact to keep track of the rows and columns to
zero out instead of using hash sets.

Notes:

  * Use a flag to indicate whether to zero out the first row or column itself

### Complexity

*Time*: O(m * n)

*Space*: O(1)
