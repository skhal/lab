# SOLUTION

## Hint

A triplet sum `x1 + x2 + x3 = C` where C is some constant is equivalent to
the problem of finding a pair [x2, x3] that satisfies the condition
`x2 + x3 = C - x1`.

## Algorithm

1. Sort the array in descending order
2. Walk the array thus fixing `x1`
  - inward scan the rest of the array for a pair [x2, x3] that satisfies the
    condition `x2 + x3 = C - x1`

## Complexity

*Time*: it is roughly equivalent to sort and scan, e.g. O(n log(n)) and O(n^2).
The second term wins leading to O(n^2).

*Space*: O(n) to hold the copy of the array for sorting.


# OPTIMIZATIONS

If `C = 0`, at least one value must have the opposite sign for the condition
`x1 + x2 + x3 = 0` to hold.

1. The beginning and the end of the array must of opposite signs.
2. Stop the scan when x1 becomes positive.

More optimizations:

3. Skip the same x1 items
4. Skip the same x2 items
5. Skip the same x3 items
