# SOLUTION

## Algorithm

1. Find pivot scanning the string from right. The pivot is the first character
   at position `i` that satisfies the following condition: `s[i] < s[i+1]`.
   All characters to the right from the pivot are in descending order.
2. If no pivot is found, reverse the string - end.
3. Find the first character at `j`, when scanned from the right, that satisfies
   the following condition: `s[i] < s[j]`.
4. Swap i and j characters.
5. Reverse the right side from the pivot.

## Complexity

*Time*: 2 linear scans if no pivot is found, else 3 linear scans, O(n)

*Space*: a buffer to store the result, O(n)
