# SOLUTION

## Algorithm

Initialization:

* Find the position of the first zero value item, `zi`.
* For each non-zero value position in the remaining array `ni`:
  - Swap the items at positions `zi` and `ni`
  - Advance `zi` by one

## Complexity

*Time*: linear scan, O(n)

*Space*: constant number of variables per iteration, O(1)
